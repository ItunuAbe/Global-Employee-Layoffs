# Global-Employee-Layoffs
In this project I analyze total laid off carried out by companies between year 2020 and 2023 using SQL tools. The dataset contains information on company layoffs, including company name, location, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, date, stage, country, and funds raised. 

Here is the Link to the dashboard in Tableau.
